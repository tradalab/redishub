## Development Guide

Quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tradalab/redishub.git
cd redishub
make deps      # Go + pnpm dependencies
make redis-up  # local Redis: standalone + sentinel + cluster, via Docker
make dev       # Next.js dev server (HMR) + Go backend, opens the app window
```

The full guide lives on the docs site, which is the single source for it — this README only
points at it, so the two can't drift apart:

- **[Getting Started](https://redishub.tradalab.com/docs/development/setup)** — prerequisites,
  runtime dependencies, workspace init, the local Redis topologies and their ports, project structure.
- **[Adding IPC Commands](https://redishub.tradalab.com/docs/development/extending)** — the
  proto-driven `service:method` flow, from `proto/app.proto` through `make generate` to the frontend call.
- **[Commands Reference](https://redishub.tradalab.com/docs/development/commands)** — every `make` target.
- **Building** — [Windows](https://redishub.tradalab.com/docs/development/build-windows) ·
  [macOS](https://redishub.tradalab.com/docs/development/build-macos) ·
  [Linux](https://redishub.tradalab.com/docs/development/build-linux).
- **[Troubleshooting](https://redishub.tradalab.com/docs/development/troubleshooting)** — embed
  failures, window not opening, cluster, port conflicts.
- **[Contribution Guide](https://redishub.tradalab.com/docs/development/contribution)** — how a
  change gets in.
